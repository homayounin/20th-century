Let's tackle the tasks in Chapter 5 one by one.

1. Install Necessary Libraries
Begin by downloading and installing the libraries from the requirements_1.5.txt file at this link.
Activate your 20th_century virtual environment in the Anaconda terminal and install the libraries by using:
bash
Copy code
conda activate 20th_century
pip install -r requirements_1.5.txt
2. Start a New Notebook
Open JupyterLab and create a new notebook. In the first cell, import all the necessary libraries for this project:
python
Copy code
from textblob import TextBlob
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import nltk
from collections import Counter
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
3. Load the Scraped Data
Load the key_events_20th_century.txt file you scraped in Chapter 4:
python
Copy code
with open('key_events_20th_century.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    text = file.read()
4. Tokenize Words and Plot Most Common Words
Tokenize the words and create a bar chart of the 10 most common words:
python
Copy code
words = word_tokenize(text)
word_counts = Counter(words)
common_words = word_counts.most_common(10)

# Convert to DataFrame for plotting
df_common_words = pd.DataFrame(common_words, columns=['Word', 'Frequency'])

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Frequency', y='Word', data=df_common_words)
plt.title('Top 10 Most Common Words')
plt.show()
5. Remove Stop Words and Punctuation, then Re-plot
Remove stop words and punctuation, then re-run the bar plot. Here’s the code for removing stop words and punctuation:
python
Copy code
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.isalnum() and word.lower() not in stop_words]

# Count the most common words again
filtered_word_counts = Counter(filtered_words)
common_filtered_words = filtered_word_counts.most_common(10)

# DataFrame for plotting
df_filtered_words = pd.DataFrame(common_filtered_words, columns=['Word', 'Frequency'])

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Frequency', y='Word', data=df_filtered_words)
plt.title('Top 10 Most Common Words (After Removing Stop Words)')
plt.show()
Comment on Changes: You should see that filler words like "the," "and," and "of" have been removed, making the plot more meaningful.
6. Create Tags List Using TextBlob
python
Copy code
text_blob = TextBlob(text)
tags_list = text_blob.tags
7. List the Top 10 POS Tags
Get the frequency of each POS tag and list the top 10:
python
Copy code
pos_counts = Counter([tag for word, tag in tags_list])
common_pos_tags = pos_counts.most_common(10)
8. Plot the Top 10 POS Tags
python
Copy code
# Convert to DataFrame
df_pos_tags = pd.DataFrame(common_pos_tags, columns=['POS Tag', 'Frequency'])

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Frequency', y='POS Tag', data=df_pos_tags)
plt.title('Top 10 POS Tags')
plt.show()
9. Create Bar Plots for Nouns, Verbs, and Adjectives
Extract and plot the top 15 nouns, verbs, and adjectives:
python
Copy code
# Filter nouns, verbs, and adjectives
nouns = [word for word, tag in tags_list if tag in ('NN', 'NNS')]
verbs = [word for word, tag in tags_list if tag.startswith('VB')]
adjectives = [word for word, tag in tags_list if tag.startswith('JJ')]

# Count and plot
for category, word_list in {'Nouns': nouns, 'Verbs': verbs, 'Adjectives': adjectives}.items():
    word_counts = Counter(word_list).most_common(15)
    df_words = pd.DataFrame(word_counts, columns=['Word', 'Frequency'])
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    sns.barplot(x='Frequency', y='Word', data=df_words)
    plt.title(f'Top 15 {category}')
    plt.show()
Comment on Observations: In the Markdown cell, describe what stands out, such as the dominance of certain nouns that indicate key themes or frequent actions in verbs.
10. Create a DataFrame of Country Mentions
Assuming you have a list of countries, count how often each appears:
python
Copy code
countries = ['Country1', 'Country2', ...]  # Replace with actual country names
country_counts = {country: text.lower().count(country.lower()) for country in countries}
df_country_mentions = pd.DataFrame(list(country_counts.items()), columns=['Country', 'Mentions'])
11. Plot Country Mention Frequencies
python
Copy code
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.barplot(x='Mentions', y='Country', data=df_country_mentions.sort_values('Mentions', ascending=False))
plt.title('Country Mention Frequencies in 20th Century Text')
plt.show()
Describe Findings: Note any trends, such as which countries are mentioned more frequently and what this suggests about 20th-century events.
12. Save and Push to GitHub
Save the notebook, download it, and push it to your GitHub repository using:
bash
Copy code
git add <notebook_name>.ipynb
git commit -m "Completed Chapter 5 tasks"
git push origin main
Bonus Task: Sentiment Analysis
Expectations: Note in a Markdown cell what sentiment trends you expect, such as whether the text will lean positive, negative, or neutral.
Run Sentiment Analysis:
python
Copy code
text_sentiment = TextBlob(text)
print(text_sentiment.sentiment)
Visualize Sentiment:
python
Copy code
sentiment_scores = {'Polarity': text_sentiment.sentiment.polarity, 'Subjectivity': text_sentiment.sentiment.subjectivity}
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
sns.barplot(x=list(sentiment_scores.keys()), y=list(sentiment_scores.values()))
plt.title('Sentiment Analysis of 20th Century Key Events')
plt.show()
This should cover the tasks for Chapter 5! Let me know if you need any further assistance with the code or explanations for any of the steps.

### Observations and Impressions

The bar plots for the top nouns, verbs, and adjectives provide interesting insights into the text's primary themes and focus areas. In the nouns plot, terms like "article," "page," and "century" suggest that the text revolves around informational or historical content, with frequent references to documentation or archival data. The verbs plot shows common actions like "check," "create," and "linked," implying that the text may include instructions or steps in a procedural context. Lastly, the adjectives plot highlights descriptors such as "20th," "alternative," and "new," indicating a focus on the 20th century, with an emphasis on novelty and change. Overall, these frequent words paint a picture of an educational or reference-oriented document that discusses the 20th century's historical events in detail.
Feel free to add this directly to your Jupyter notebook under the plots. Let me know if you need further help with other parts!

### Insights on Country Mention Frequencies

This bar plot provides a snapshot of the frequency of country mentions in our 20th-century text analysis. The data reveals that the "United States" and "Canada" are among the most frequently mentioned, suggesting a significant focus on North American events, trends, or influences. India also appears prominently, which could reflect discussions on major historical developments, such as independence movements or its role in global affairs during this century. Australia, though mentioned less, indicates its presence within the narrative, possibly due to its geopolitical or cultural impact during specific periods. Overall, this visualization helps us understand the geographic focal points of the text and might guide further exploration into the historical context of each country's mention.
This should provide an insightful summary of what the plot shows, adding a more engaging interpretation of the data for your notebook. Let me know if you need any additional tweaks!
