Let’s walk through these tasks step-by-step to help you complete each requirement for your text analysis and NER (Named Entity Recognition) project. I'll provide an outline for setting up your environment and each instruction in detail.

Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries
In your virtual environment, ensure that the required libraries are installed. Open your terminal, navigate to the environment where you want to install the libraries, and enter:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 2: Start a New Notebook and Import Libraries
Launch JupyterLab.

Start a new Python notebook.

Import the libraries you’ll need. Below is a template; adjust based on what’s in your requirements.txt:

python
Copy code
# Core libraries
import pandas as pd
import spacy

# Additional libraries if specified
# For example:
# from spacy import displacy
Step 3: Load the Text File
Place the text file (e.g., twentieth-century.txt) in the same directory as your Jupyter notebook to simplify loading. Use this code to load it:

python
Copy code
# Load the text file
with open('twentieth-century.txt', 'r') as file:
    text = file.read()
Step 4: Evaluate and Clean the Text
Identify special characters:

Review the text manually or with a quick search to see if any unusual characters are present.

Run the following code to print the first few lines for inspection:

python
Copy code
print(text[:1000])  # Display the first 1000 characters for a quick check
Check Country Names:

If you have a list of countries, confirm that the names match those in your text.

Here’s an example list (you can modify it based on your data):

python
Copy code
country_list = ["United States", "Canada", "United Kingdom", "France", "Germany"]
Text Cleaning:

Replace special characters or adjust country names if needed:

python
Copy code
# Example: Replace unusual characters
text = text.replace("—", "-").replace("‘", "'").replace("’", "'")
Save the cleaned text (if modified):

python
Copy code
with open('twentieth-century-cleaned.txt', 'w') as file:
    file.write(text)
Step 5: Create a Named Entity Recognition (NER) Object
Load the English language model in SpaCy, then create a Doc object by processing the text:

python
Copy code
# Load SpaCy's English NER model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

# Create the NER object
doc = nlp(text)
Step 6: Split Sentence Entities from the NER Object
To break down the document into sentences and extract entities within each sentence:

python
Copy code
# List to store sentences and entities
sentences_entities = []

# Iterate through sentences in the NER document
for sentence in doc.sents:
    # Extract entities in each sentence
    entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in sentence.ents]
    sentences_entities.append((sentence.text, entities))
    
# Display the first few sentences with their entities
sentences_entities[:5]
Step 7: Filter Entities for Country Names
Filter the entities so that only countries from your list are retained:

python
Copy code
# Filter sentences to keep only entities that are in the country list
filtered_entities = [
    (sentence, [(entity, label) for entity, label in entities if entity in country_list and label == 'GPE'])
    for sentence, entities in sentences_entities
]

# Remove sentences with no relevant entities
filtered_entities = [(sentence, entities) for sentence, entities in filtered_entities if entities]

# Display filtered results
filtered_entities[:5]
Step 8: Create the Relationships DataFrame
Now, let’s convert this data into a DataFrame for analysis:

python
Copy code
# Create DataFrame for relationships
relationships = []

# Process the filtered sentences and entities
for sentence, entities in filtered_entities:
    if len(entities) > 1:  # Ensure there are multiple countries in the sentence
        for i in range(len(entities) - 1):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(entities)):
                relationships.append({
                    'Sentence': sentence,
                    'Country1': entities[i][0],
                    'Country2': entities[j][0]
                })

# Convert to DataFrame
relationships_df = pd.DataFrame(relationships)

# Show the first few rows
relationships_df.head()
Step 9: Save and Export the DataFrame
Export the relationships DataFrame to a CSV file:

python
Copy code
# Save DataFrame to CSV
relationships_df.to_csv('country_relationships.csv', index=False)
Step 10: Save, Push to GitHub, and Send for Review
Save your notebook:

Go to File > Save and Checkpoint in JupyterLab.
Download Notebook:

Download the notebook by selecting File > Download As > Notebook (.ipynb).
Push to GitHub:

In your terminal, navigate to your project’s folder.

Use these commands to push to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Completed NER relationships extraction"
git push origin main
Send for Review:

Once pushed, share the GitHub link with your mentor.
This completes all the steps needed for this project. Let me know if you have any questions on specific steps or need further clarification!

this is the name of the notebook please add it the int other this command I want to run this commenad in bash = 1.6 Intro to NLP and Network Analysis = git add .
git commit -m "Completed NER relationships extraction"

In bash, to handle a file name with spaces (like 1.6 Intro to NLP and Network Analysis), you’ll need to put the file name in quotes or escape the spaces. Here’s how to run these commands with the specific notebook name:

Command to Add and Commit the Specific Notebook File
bash
Copy code
git add "1.6 Intro to NLP and Network Analysis.ipynb"
git commit -m "Completed NER relationships extraction"
git push origin main
Or, using backslashes to escape spaces:

bash
Copy code
git add 1.6\ Intro\ to\ NLP\ and\ Network\ Analysis.ipynb
git commit -m "Completed NER relationships extraction"
git push origin main
This will add only the specific notebook file to the staging area, commit it with your message, and push the changes to the main branch. Let me know if you need further assistance!
